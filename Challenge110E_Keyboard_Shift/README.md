## Description
You and a friend are working on a very important, bleeding-edge, research paper: "Computational Complexity of Sorting Pictures of Cats with Funny Text on the Web". The catch though is your friend wrote his part of the paper with his hands shifted to the right, meaning the top row of keys he used weren't "QWERTYUIOP" (regular US keyboard), but instead "WERTYUIOP{".
Your goal is to take what your friend wrote, and convert it from his broken shifted text back into regular english!

### Input
String ShiftedText - The shifted text in question. The only chracters you have to deal with are letters, in both cases, and the following symbols: '{', '[', ':', ';', '<', ','. The space character may be present, but you do not have to shift that.

#### Sample Input
Jr;;p ept;f

### Output
Print the correct text.

#### Sample Output
Hello World
