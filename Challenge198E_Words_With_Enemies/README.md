## Description
There is a valley. On each side you got cannons. They are firing words at each other. In the middle of the valley the words would make contact and explode. Similar letters from each word would cancel out. But the left over unique letters from each word would fall to the valley and slowly fill it up.
So your challenge is to come up with the code given two words you eliminate letters in common at a ratio of 1 for 1 and produce a set of letters that are left over from each word after colliding in mid air. Which ever side has the most letters left over "wins". If each side donates an equal amount of letters it is a "tie".

### Input
Two words ordered from which side of the valley they come from:
 <left side word> <right side word>

#### Sample Input
 hat cat

### Output
List the extra letters left over after they collide and explode in mid air and determine which side wins or if it was a tie.

#### Sample Output
hc - Tie
