## Description
Implement the famous Vigen√®re cipher. The Wikipedia article explains well how it works, but here's a short description anyway:
You take a message that you want to encrypt, for instance "THECAKEISALIE" (lets assume that all characters are upper-case and there are no spaces in the messages, for the sake of simplicity), and a key you want to encrypt it with, for instance "GLADOS". You then write the message with the key repeated over it, like this:
GLADOSGLADOSG
THECAKEISALIE
The key is repeated as often as is needed to cover the entire message.
Now, one by one, each letter of the key is "added" to the letter of the clear-text to produce the cipher-text. That is, if A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, etc, then E + G = K (because E = 4 and G = 6, and 4 + 6 = 10, and K = 10). If the sum is larger than 25 (i.e. larger than Z), it starts from the beginning, so S + K = C (i.e. 18 + 10 = 28, and 28 - 26 is equal to 2, which is C).
For a full chart of how characters combine to form new characters, see here
The cipher text then becomes:
GLADOSGLADOSG
THECAKEISALIE
