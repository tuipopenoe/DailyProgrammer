## Description
In "The adventure of the barren moor" the player is in the middle of an infinite grey swamp. This grey swamp has few distinguishing characteristics, other than the fact that it is large and infinite and dreary. However, the player DOES have a magic compass that tells the player how far away the next feature of interest is.
The player can go north,south,east,or west. In my original version of the game, there was only one feature of interest, a treasure chest at a random point in the world.
