## Description
So went to a Casino recently. I noticed at the Blackjack tables the house tends to use several decks and not 1. My mind began to wonder about how likely natural blackjacks (getting an ace and a card worth 10 points on the deal) can occur.
So for this monday challenge lets look into this. We need to be able to shuffle deck of playing cards. (52 cards) and be able to deal out virtual 2 card hands and see if it totals 21 or not.
Develop a way to shuffle 1 to 10 decks of 52 playing cards.
Using this shuffle deck(s) deal out hands of 2s
count how many hands you deal out and how many total 21 and output the percentage.

### Output
After x hands there was y blackjacks at z%.
Example Output:
