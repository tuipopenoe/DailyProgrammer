## Description
Welcome to this week's Theme Week. We're going to be creating our very own basic compression format for short novels or writing. This format will probably not be practical for actual use, but may serve as a rudimentary introduction to how data compression works. As a side task, it is advised to use structured programming techniques, so your program is easy to extend, modify and maintain later on (ie. later this week.) To keep in line with our Easy-Intermediate-Hard trend, our first step will be to write the decompresser.
The basic idea of this compression scheme will be the dictionary system. Words used in the data will be put into a dictionary, so instead of repeating phrases over and over again, you can just repeat a number instead, thus saving space. Also, because this system is based around written text, it will be specifically designed to handle sentences and punctuation, and will not be geared to handle binary data.

Formal Inputs and Outputs
Input Description
The first section of the input we are going to receive will be the dictionary. This dictionary is just a list of words present in the text we're decompressing. The first line of input will be a number N representing how many entries the dictionary has. Following from that will be a list of N words, on separate lines. This will be our simple dictionary. After this will be the data.
Data Format
The pre-compressed data will be split up into human-readable 'chunks', representing one little segment of the output. In a practical compression system, they will be represented by a few bytes rather than text, but doing it this way makes it easier to write. Our chunks will follow 7 simple rules:
If the chunk is just a number (eg. 37), word number 37 from the dictionary (zero-indexed, so 0 is the 1st word) is printed lower-case.
If the chunk is a number followed by a caret (eg. 37^), then word 37 from the dictionary will be printed lower-case, with the first letter capitalised.
If the chunk is a number followed by an exclamation point (eg. 37!), then word 37 from the dictionary will be printed upper-case.
If it's a hyphen (-), then instead of putting a space in-between the previous and next words, put a hyphen instead.
If it's any of the following symbols: . , ? ! ; :, then put that symbol at the end of the previous outputted word.
If it's a letter R (upper or lower), print a new line.
If it's a letter E (upper or lower), the end of input has been reached.
Remember, this is just for basic text, so not all possible inputs can be compressed. Ignore any other whitespace, like tabs or newlines, in the input.
Note: All words will be in the Latin alphabet.
Example Data
Therefore, if our dictionary consists of the following:
is
my
hello
name
stan
And we are given the following chunks:
2! ! R 1^ 3 0 4^ . E
Then the output text is:
HELLO!
My name is Stan.
Words are always separated by spaces unless they're hyphenated.


### Output
Print the resultant decompressed data from your decompression algorithm, using the rules described above.
