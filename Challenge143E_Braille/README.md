## Description
Braille is a writing system based on a series of raised / lowered bumps on a material, for the purpose of being read through touch rather than sight. It's an incredibly powerful reading & writing system for those who are blind / visually impaired. Though the letter system has up to 64 unique glyph, 26 are used in English Braille for letters. The rest are used for numbers, words, accents, ligatures, etc.
Your goal is to read in a string of Braille characters (using standard English Braille defined here) and print off the word in standard English letters. You only have to support the 26 English letters.

### Input
Input will consistent of an array of 2x6 space-delimited Braille characters. This array is always on the same line, so regardless of how long the text is, it will always be on 3-rows of text. A lowered bump is a dot character '.', while a raised bump is an upper-case 'O' character.

### Output
Print the transcribed Braille.
