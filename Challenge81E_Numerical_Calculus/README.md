## Description
For a lot of the questions today we are going to be doing some simple numerical calculus. Don't worry, its not too terrifying.
For the easy problem, write a function that can take in a list of y-values that represents a function sampled on some domain. The domain can be specified as a list of x-values or two values for the x-minimum and x-maximum (the x-coordinates of the endpoints)
This function should output another list of values that represents the derivative of that function over the same domain.

### Input
print derivative(xmin=-1,xmax=1,y=[-1.0,-.5,0,.5,1.0])

### Output
[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]
