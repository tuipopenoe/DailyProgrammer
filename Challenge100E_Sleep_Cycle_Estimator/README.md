## Description
The human body goes through 90 minute sleep cycles during the night, and you 
feel more refreshed if you wake up at the end of a sleep cycle than if you wake 
up during a sleep cycle. The challenge is to make a program that takes a wake-
up time and outputs the possible times to fall asleep so that you will wake up 
at the end of a sleep cycle.

### Input
