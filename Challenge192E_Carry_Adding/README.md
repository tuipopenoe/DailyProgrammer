## Description

When you were first learning arithmetic, the way most people were tought to set out addition problems was like follows:
23+456=

  23
+456
 ---
 479
 ---
Look familiar? And remember how, if the number went above 10, you put the number below the line:
 559
+447
 ---
1006
 ---
 11
Those 1s under the line are called the carry values - they are 'carried' from one column into the next. In today's challenge, you will take some numbers, add them up and (most importantly) display the output like it is shown above.


### Input
Input Description
You will accept a list of non-negative integers in the format:
559+447+13+102
Such that the carry value will never be greater than 9.
