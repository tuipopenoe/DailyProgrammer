## Description
In tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, people use a system called dice notation to represent a combination of dice to be rolled to generate a random number. Dice rolls are of the form AdB (+/-) C, and are calculated like this:
Generate A random numbers from 1 to B and add them together.
Add or subtract the modifier, C.
If A is omitted, its value is 1; if (+/-)C is omitted, step 2 is skipped. That is, "d8" is equivalent to "1d8+0".
Write a function that takes a string like "10d6-2" or "d20+7" and generates a random number using this syntax.
Here's a hint on how to parse the strings, if you get stuck:
Split the string over 'd' first; if the left part is empty, A = 1,
otherwise, read it as an integer and assign it to A. Then determine
whether or not the second part contains a '+' or '-', etc.
