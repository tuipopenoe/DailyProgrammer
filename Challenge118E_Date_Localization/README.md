## Description
Localization of software is the process of adapting code to handle special properties of a given language or a region's standardization of date / time formats.
As an example, in the United States it is common to write down a date first with the month, then day, then year. In France, it is common to write down the day and then month, then year.
Your goal is to write a function that takes a given string that defines how dates and times should be ordered, and then print off the current date-time in that format.

### Input
Your function must accept a string "Format". This string can have any set of characters or text, but you must explicitly replace certain special-characters with their equivalent date-time element. Those special characters, and what they map to, are as follows:
"%l": Milliseconds (000 to 999) "%s": Seconds (00 to 59) "%m": Minutes (00 to 59) "%h": Hours (in 1 to 12 format) "%H": Hours (in 0 to 23 format) "%c": AM / PM (regardless of hour-format) "%d": Day (1 up to 31) "%M": Month (1 to 12) "%y": Year (four-digit format)

#### Sample Input
"%s.%l"
"%s:%m:%h %M/%d/%y"
"The minute is %m! The hour is %h."

### Output
The output must be the given string, but with the appropriate date-time special-characters replaced with the current date-time of your system. All other characters should be left untouched.
Sample Inputs & Outputs

#### Sample Output
"32.429"
"32:6:9 07/9/2013"
"The minute is 32! The hour is 6."
