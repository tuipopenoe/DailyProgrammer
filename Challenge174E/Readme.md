The Thue-Morse sequence is a binary sequence (of 0s and 1s) that never repeats.
 It is obtained by starting with 0 and successively calculating the Boolean 
 complement of the sequence so far. It turns out that doing this yields an 
 infinite, non-repeating sequence. This procedure yields 0 then 01, 0110, 
 01101001, 0110100110010110, and so on.
