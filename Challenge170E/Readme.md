Blackjack is a very common card game, where the primary aim is to pick up 
cards until your hand has a higher value than everyone else but is less than 
or equal to 21. This challenge will look at the outcome of the game, rather 
than playing the game itself.
The value of a hand is determined by the cards in it.
Numbered cards are worth their number - eg. a 6 of Hearts is worth 6.
Face cards (JQK) are worth 10.
Ace can be worth 1 or 11.
The person with the highest valued hand wins, with one exception - if a person 
has 5 cards in their hand and it has any value 21 or less, then they win 
automatically. This is called a 5 card trick.
If the value of your hand is worth over 21, you are 'bust', and automatically 
lose.
Your challenge is, given a set of players and their hands, print who wins (or 
if it is a tie game.)
