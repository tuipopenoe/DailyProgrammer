## Description
ISBN's (International Standard Book Numbers) are identifiers for books. Given the correct sequence of digits, one book can be identified out of millions of others thanks to this ISBN. But when is an ISBN not just a random slurry of digits? That's for you to find out.



### Input 
obtain the sum of 10 times the first digit, 9 times the second digit, 8 times the third digit... all the way till you add 1 times the last digit. If the sum leaves no remainder when divided by 11 the code is a valid ISBN.

#### Sample Input
0-7475-3269-9

### Output
Given the following constraints of the ISBN number, you should write a function that can return True if a number is a valid ISBN and False otherwise.


#### Sample Output

Write an ISBN generator. That is, a programme that will output a valid ISBN number
