## Description
Last week we had [6/18/2014] Challenge #167 [Intermediate] Final Grades
For this challenge I generated data using excel. It was a bit time consuming but for the limited data set it was not too bad. But what if we needed 100 students? Or 1000? Or even 10000?
Sometimes it is useful to use programs to generate test data to test programs. For today's challenge your task is to generate the test data for that challenge.


### Input
n -- representing how many random student records to generate
Let us assume N will always be a positive number and I will let you decide what upper bound if any you want to set.
I would recommend running your solution on 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000. Maybe post a sampling of 10 to show what you can generate.

### Output
Should be a listing either via console out or a text file or other of your choice that is the test data. To remind you what a record looks like:
(first name) , (last name) (score 1) (score 2) (score 3) (score 4) (score 5)
For example of a student roster see the Intermediate challenge's input
