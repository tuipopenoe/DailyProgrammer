## Description

"I'm sorry we had to call you in at such small notice but our last admin royally screwed us over. I don't suppose you can have a scout through the files and see if there's any remnants of that slimeball left in our system can you? Any leftover documents, programs, CV's, ANYTHING you can find about him, I need it so I can finish him."
A few weeks pass
