## Description
Write A function that takes an amount of money, rounds it to the nearest penny and then tells you the minimum number of coins needed to equal that amount of money. For Example: "4.17" would print out:
Quarters: 16
Dimes: 1
Nickels: 1
Pennies: 2


### Input
Your Function should accept a decimal number (which may or may not have an actual decimal, in which you can assume it is an integer representing dollars, not cents). Your function should round this number to the nearest hundredth.

#### Sample Input

Quarters: <integer>
Dimes: <integer>
Nickels: <integer>
Pennies: <integer>

#### Sample Output
Quarters: 4
Dimes: 2
